I am currently a Research Scientist / Staff Engineer leading the Agent Strategy Team at Baidu Qianfan (Beijing), working on advancing the research and development in LLMs and LLM-based Agents.
Before that, I worked as a Research Scientist at Baidu Search.
I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), under the supervision of Prof. Sun Le and Prof. Han Xianpei.
My research interests focus on Large Language Models, LLM-based Agents, Model Alignment, and related areas.
I have published over 20 papers at top-tier AI conferences, including ACL, NeurIPS, ICLR and EMNLP, and my work received the Outstanding Paper Award at EMNLP 2023.
