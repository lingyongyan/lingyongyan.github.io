I am currently a Research Scientist and Staff Engineer at the Agent Team in Baidu Search (Beijing), working on advancing the research and development in Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents.
I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), under the supervision of Prof. Le Sun and Prof. Xianpei Han.
My recent research interests include Large Language Models, LLM-based Agents, Model Alignment, and other related topics.
I have published over 20 papers at leading AI conferences, and my work received the Outstanding Paper Award at EMNLP 2023.
